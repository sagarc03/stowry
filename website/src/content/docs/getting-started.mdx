# Getting Started

This guide will have you running Stowry and storing your first file in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A terminal/command line
- `curl` for making HTTP requests (or any HTTP client)

## Step 1: Download Stowry

Download the latest release for your platform:

```bash
# Linux (amd64)
curl -LO https://github.com/sagarc03/stowry/releases/latest/download/stowry-linux-amd64
chmod +x stowry-linux-amd64
mv stowry-linux-amd64 stowry

# macOS (arm64)
curl -LO https://github.com/sagarc03/stowry/releases/latest/download/stowry-darwin-arm64
chmod +x stowry-darwin-arm64
mv stowry-darwin-arm64 stowry
```

## Step 2: Create Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
server:
  port: 5708
  mode: store

database:
  type: sqlite
  dsn: stowry.db
  table: stowry_metadata

storage:
  path: ./data

auth:
  region: us-east-1
  service: s3
  keys:
    - access_key: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
      secret_key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

access:
  public_read: false
  public_write: false

log:
  level: info
```

## Step 3: Start the Server

```bash
./stowry serve
```

You should see:

```
INFO starting server addr=:5708 mode=store
```

## Step 4: Upload a File

Stowry uses presigned URLs for authentication. For this quick test, enable public write access temporarily by setting `public_write: true` in your config, then restart the server.

Upload a file:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "Hello, Stowry!" \
  http://localhost:5708/hello.txt
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "path": "hello.txt",
  "content_type": "text/plain",
  "etag": "a591a6d40bf420404a011733cfb7b190d62c65bf0bcda32b57b277d9ad9f146e",
  "file_size_bytes": 14,
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Step 5: Download the File

```bash
curl http://localhost:5708/hello.txt
```

Output:

```
Hello, Stowry!
```

## Step 6: Use Presigned URLs (Production)

For production, disable public access and use presigned URLs. See the [Authentication guide](authentication) for generating presigned URLs with the stowry-go SDK or AWS SDK.

```go
import stowry "github.com/sagarc03/stowry-go"

client := stowry.NewClient(
    "http://localhost:5708",
    "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
    "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
)

// Generate a presigned URL valid for 15 minutes
uploadURL := client.PresignPut("/photos/vacation.jpg", 900)
```

## Next Steps
